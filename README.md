# XAMPP Data Project: Project_6 Database Export

## Project Overview

This repository contains the exported SQL database file `Project_6.sql` from a data analysis project conducted using XAMPP and phpMyAdmin. The project focuses on managing and analyzing structured data related to [insert your project domain here, e.g., volunteer management, disaster relief coordination, skills tracking, inventory management, etc.].

The database was designed and implemented to provide a robust foundation for storing, querying, and extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. This project demonstrates practical skills in database design, SQL query writing, data normalization, and data-driven decision making.

## Database Structure and Contents

The `Project_6.sql` file includes:

- **Schema Definitions:** Detailed table structures including primary keys, foreign keys, data types, and constraints to ensure data integrity.
- **Table Data:** Sample and/or actual data entries used for analysis.
- **Relationships:** Proper relational links between tables to allow complex queries across multiple data points.

### Key Tables Included

| Table Name | Description                             |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| SKILLS     | Stores various skills and competencies related to individuals or roles |
| VOLUNTEERS | Contains records of volunteer personnel including contact and availability information |
| TASKS      | Lists tasks assigned or available for coordination during projects or events |

## Usage Instructions

### Importing the Database

To work with this database, you need to import the SQL file into your MySQL server. You can do this via the phpMyAdmin graphical interface or the MySQL command line tool.

#### Using phpMyAdmin

1. Log into your phpMyAdmin panel (usually via `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` if using XAMPP locally).
2. Create a new database, e.g., `project6_db`.
3. Select the new database, click the **Import** tab.
4. Choose the `Project_6.sql` file and start the import process.
5. Once imported, you can browse tables and run queries within phpMyAdmin.

#### Using MySQL Command Line

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < Project_6.sql
